# M1_Student-Record-Management-System
# Introduction
 Student record management system is intended to help accomplish the daily school activities of recording and upholding by systematizing it. The system is prepared with a robust set of structures like modify record, delete record, search record etc. These tools help in handling the institute competently and accurately.

Educational institutions need to manage vast data of students for handling school affairs systematically. To streamline the process of managing student data, a lot of educational institutions are investing in a high-performance student record management system. The student record management system automates the process of data handling, thus, saving you a great deal of time. Whatâ€™s more, it also reduces the probabilities of human error.

This project compiled in Visual Studio Code. This request based on file handling in C, where I have cast-off a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, ..etc. 
using multiple record management increase the legibility, I have broken the application in different functions. Each function of the project widely use in the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling in C.
